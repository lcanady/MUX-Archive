Wow, it's been a really long time since I've updated this archive.  Things are 
slowly going to move around as I re-organize for new projects.  Exciting things
are in the works!  

Enjoy what you can, it's formatted for an up-and-coming project, but should be
pretty easy to remove for right now with your standard MU* formatter code. 

Thanks for taking a look!
